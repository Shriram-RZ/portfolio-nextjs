          <p>
            I'm a Computer Science and Business Systems student graduating in 2025, 
            with a passion for building full-stack web applications and exploring 
            innovative technologies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, I'm developing multiple projects including a freelance hiring 
            platform called 'Zuno', a safety application called 'Safe Route', and 
            various AI-powered solutions. I actively participate in hackathons and 
            contribute to open-source projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            My expertise lies in backend development with Spring Boot and Java, 
            coupled with modern frontend frameworks like React and Next.js. I'm 
            always eager to learn new technologies and take on challenging projects.
